Gravity Menagerie is a multiplatform game created by Rebecca Taylor and Kursat Mestav. We implemented it in Processing language. 
You need to control the black hole to move the farm animals and feed them without damaging.

There are three levels with different difficulties nad a creative sandbox level.
