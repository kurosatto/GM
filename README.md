Gravity Menagerie is a multiplatform game created by Rebecca Taylor and Kursat Mestav. We implemented it in Processing language. 
You need to control the black hole to move the farm animals and feed them without damaging.

There are three levels with different difficulties and a creative sandbox level. The game is under development, but there are three levels you can play. I also uploaded the .exe file to run it on Windows.
